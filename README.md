# LogWave ðŸŒŠ

LogWave is a Go library designed to facilitate seamless logging to Grafana Loki, with plans to expand its capabilities to other logging platforms in the future.

## Features
- Asynchronous logging to Loki using buffered channels.
- Extensible configuration model to fetch Loki configurations.
- Five logging levels: Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal.
- Support for additional labels in log entries.
- Built with scalability and performance in mind.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To integrate LogWave into your project, use the `go get` command:

\```bash
go get github.com/pakabah/logwave
\```

Replace `github.com/pakabah/logwave` with the actual path to your library.

### Usage

1. First, initialize the Loki logger with the desired configuration:

\```go
import "github.com/pakabah/logwave/logger"

config := logger.LoadLokiConfig()
lokiLogger := logger.NewLokiLogger(config)
\```

2. Now you can use the logger to send logs at various levels:

\```go
lokiLogger.Debug("This is a debug message", map[string]string{"key": "value"})
lokiLogger.Info("This is an info message", nil)
lokiLogger.Warn("This is a warning", nil)
lokiLogger.Error("Oops! An error occurred", nil)
lokiLogger.Fatal("Fatal error encountered", nil)
\```

3. When you're done logging, or before your application exits, remember to close the logger:

\```go
lokiLogger.Close()
\```

## Future Plans
- Support for more logging platforms apart from Loki.
- Advanced features like log batching, retries, and better error handling.
